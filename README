h2. ProtoMan!

As Djangophiles interested in taking on PHP work without all the pain (we know it well), Comfy Chair decided to implement our favorite parts of Django and turn them into a relatively simple PHP framework.  This is the result-in-progress.

h3. Features

There's a relatively small set of "holy crap that's awesome" stuff we figured we needed for this project to actually be useful to us commercially.

h4. Complete

* App-based site design
* Multi-database configuration for dev/prod/test environments
* Sandboxed testing framework based on simple PHP with simple reporting
* Regex-based project- and app-based URL routing with arbitrarily-defined slugs/id's
* 'Reverse' URL building
* Automatic form generation based on defined types
* 'contrib'-style basic apps including basic auth (user)
* Arbitrary caching integration (memcached stock) with session fallback
* Flexible database types with validation support
* Automatic table creation based on models
* Automatic admin interface generation
* Native many-to-many support with basic PHP object/array operators
* Simple template inheritance (without interfering with the use of standard PHP)
* Support for calling multiple views per request
* Basic ORM queries (get by ID, filter, order, group, insert, update, delete)
* Database abstraction

h4. Incomplete

* Advanced ORM queries (e.g. Q objects)
* Database-agnostic create statements (needs minor updates to be generic)
* Migration-style table updates for schema changes
* Group and permission models for auth module
* Generic, gracefully-failing AJAX support through generated links

h4. Current items of interest

* Clean up Saveable (base ORM) class (was ported from being a standalone ORM, needs love)

h3. Project parameters

Working within the confines of PHP, we're limited in certain ways (some of which we've chosen voluntarily).

h4. Requirements

* Maintain compatibility with PHP 5.2.x

h4. Concessions/omissions

* Namespaces (unsupported pre-5.3)
* Decorators (using queued views instead)
